										<h1>Project Idea</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I would like to one day develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Multiplayer Online Battle Arena’s (MOBA’s) such as League of Legends or DOTA 2 that learns and adapts from the games it plays continuously to eventually become unstoppable. The AI would develop skills and mechanics essential to the game such as last hitting minions to gain gold and experience, executing spells and items to fight the enemy team over time as it keeps playing more and more games. Ideally, as each game the AI plays it will gradually improve. There should also be stages of the AI of how good of a player it is such as a beginner level, intermediate level and pro level. </p>
									<p>This project would be interesting because it demonstrates that AI can learn from its own experiences and grow. This idea of AI self-learning can also be transferred into real life robots and with the new age development of robots, self-learning AI could play a significant part in its development like JARVAS from Ironman or Alpha 5 from The Power Rangers. I first saw this in The International 2018 (DOTA 2) also known as TI8 where a bot programmed funded by Elon Musk called OpenAI5 played against the world’s best DOTA 2 players in a 5vs5 match. Despite losing, it was still amazing how bots were able to match up against professionals. To be able to make an AI like this would be outstanding and be programmed only limited to the imagination of the programmer. As I play DOTA 2 myself, having an AI like this would help me get better at the game or even if I one day decided to transition to League of Legends it would help give me and other players a kick start.</p>
									<p>Key features of the self-learning and adaptable AI would be that there can be set levels that was briefly demonstrated earlier, this can be used as a teaching and learning tool for real people players at all levels who seek to improve in MOBA’s, whether you’re just starting to play and have no idea or at a professional level the . Real people players can use each bot similar to or higher than their skill level to play against and learn from as opposed to playing against other real people players or even have AI levels calibrated and programmed with common characteristics of play style, skills and mechanics based on the ranking system of a particular MOBA game. There would not be any incoming toxicity coming from the bot if the person was losing which can happen from real people opponents. In saying this, the AI can also be an alternative way to play the game if a real life player is annoyed from playing against other real players which can be common in playing MOBA’s, hence the AI can also act an escape or relieving mechanism from other real players. Another feature of the AI would be having specified AI that are especially good at the games skills and mechanics such as having one AI being at a “professional-level” of last hitting minions / creeps (to gain gold and experience), another example of this can be having an AI that is “professional-level” in a specific lane such as the mid, bottom or top lane, as each of these lane has a different role and play style. Therefore, the real people player that would be utilising the AI can match themselves up against a playstyle specific AI if they wish to get better against playing against that playstyle or role they have chosen to play against.</p> 
									<p>Some potential drawbacks could be the pace of which the AI learns from its experiences, where it might take over hundreds of games to make slight improvement and this will not be time effective and may just become too time consuming from a business side of things, thus, costing a lot of time and money to build. As the games update, and there are changes made to the meta, skills and items, this would mean that the AI will also have to be constantly updated to suit the changes that have been made to the game and adjust skills and items if they have been changed also. By having to adjust the AI, it may bring about other conflicting bugs and errors that could be made to the code when updating it, resulting in having to spend more time to fix these new problems. Another obstacle that may occur during the testing and trialling phase of the AI is that after a certain time-frame in a match the AI may “hit-the-wall” and not know what to do after that, this was seen during TI8, one of the world’s largest esports competition where after 20 minutes of the game commencing the AI were unsure what to do. To solve this the AI would have to play many matches that last longer after “hitting-the-wall” so they are able to learn from those experiences.</p>
									<p>Programming languages like C++, Lisp, Java, Prolog and Python can be used to develop AI from nothing. Visual mapping tools can be used to create a visual layout of how to model AI components such as neural networks, image recognition software and chatbots without having to learn the code for it. Software such as Azure Machine Learning Studio and SPSS Modeler from IBM are AI visual modelling tools. RapidMiner and Knime which are data science modelling software are essential in the process of creating AI. </p>
									<p>Skillsets required to create AI is to be proficient with programming languages such as Java, Python and C++ as listed earlier, but also to be proficient in software development and having some experience or even a basic idea of Artificial Intelligence. It is also key that the there is knowledge about machine learning, where the AI can learn from its experiences without having it definitively programmed in the AI. To find people with skills to create AI is most definitely feasible, there is already development of AI, but to find it in the first year of Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, not yet.</p>
									<p>If the project is successful one day, it can be used to help the growth of MOBA’s players skills exponentially at all skill ranges, it can be utilised by professional MOBA teams to help train their players if they are unable to scrim (play against other professional teams). I hope to one day create an AI even if it is basic and build up to create one like Elon Musk’s funded OpenAI5 project with a team of similar interest once I have attained enough experience and knowledge. </p>
