												<h3>Interests in IT</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I have an interest in IT because it is evident that the world is already advancing in technology, and studying IT would help obtain a job in a rapidly growing industry. Another reason is that I love playing games, this ties in to the fact that my interest in IT began when I was around 7 to 8 years old when I got my first gaming system, the Playstation 2. My interest in IT kept growing as more gaming systems came out such as the PSP, Nintendo DS and Wii that I would spend endless hours on playing my favourite games like the Pokemon series, God of War and Mario Kart. It was when I built my first gaming PC at the end of 2017 my interest in IT had exponentially grown, it took me to a whole new level, opening gateways of interest such as how the CPU worked with other components in the PC such as the RAM and GPU.
I had not originally intended to come to RMIT, I was offered a Bachelor of Business and IT at Monash University in the first round offer. When I was offered a placement in Bachelor of IT at RMIT I instantly transferred, the main reason for this is because of the commute, as I live much close to RMIT than to Monash University.
I expect to learn and obtain at minimum a satisfactory level of understanding of how computer parts interact and work together and coding in the programming language of Java during my studies of Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.

												<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
											</header>
											<p> https://www.seek.com.au/job/38512390?type=standout&searchrequesttoken=974a1bab-4904-42af-822d-a95cf1ecc8c7 <p>
											<p>My ideal job is a penetration tester. This position is looking for a the most suitable person/s to “perform penetration tests and vulnerability assessments” against client IT framework and their web applications. It is also required to be able to write a comprehensive report on the penetration tests and vulnerability assessments. 
What appeals to me in this position is that you get to hack into other people’s infrastructure and businesses but use ethical hacking for a good cause. Hacking, which is more often associated with the “bad guys” in movies and used for illegal purposes, penetration testing uses ethical hacking techniques to strengthen the security for clients.
The position requires the candidate to convey a willing undivided attention in penetration testing and portray knowledge of ethical hacking techniques. The candidate should be able to write detailed reports with outstanding communication quality as well as learn new skills rapidly. Having a previous programming experience and a certification in penetration testing is highly regarded, preferably an OSCP certificate.
0 skill, 0 qualifications, only experience is what I have learnt from my Bachelor of Information Technology course so far.
To obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, I plan to find an internship during or after my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT to acquire entry level experience. To build on this I expect to finish my Bachelor of Information Technology and find a job in a relevant field after, whether it be computer security or even straight into penetration testing.

												<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I would say that the results test taken seem accurate on how they portray my personality and learning approaches. As for what the results of the tests and what they mean to me, they do not really mean too much me. Yes, they are accurate for how I am now, however the results may change over time as I get older and my thought processes and outlook changes.
I don’t believe the results will influence my behaviour in a team. As I am team oriented when working in a team of any size, I strongly believe I will stay that way and the test results will not influence how I behave in a team environment.
When forming a team, I would form a team based of characteristics and mind sets that is suitable to the end goal where all team members are on the same page. It is also key that there is diversity among team members.
